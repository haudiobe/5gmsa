# 5GMSA: 5G Media Streaming Architecture discussion

## Logistics:
1)	For e-mail discussion we use the SA4 MBS list 3GPP_TSG_SA_WG4_MBS@LIST.ETSI.ORG (In CC). You can subscribe here: https://list.etsi.org/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=3GPP_TSG_SA_WG4_MBS&A=1
2)	The document is provided online for looking at it: https://1drv.ms/w/s!AiNJEPgowJnWgd91mnHNCSE219nLoA â€“ it cannot be edited by this link. However, if you want to get editing rights, please send me a request and I will provide you a link for editing.
3)	I invite to use github for discussion on the document. Issues can be tracked more easily.
